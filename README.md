# Eco Water

Our solution to the proposed challenge: an application that allows users to assess the quality of local bodies of water and learn about the threatened species that inhabit these waters, as well as protect them. We believe that our solution is not only relevant but also transformative. It empowers people with the necessary knowledge to make informed decisions on how to interact with bodies of water, protect threatened species, and promote environmental preservation.

We have developed this solution in a functional manner, using cutting-edge technology and creativity, ensuring that it is a powerful and accessible tool for everyone, following the accessibility standards of the Android system resources. Our application not only provides critical information but also educates people on how to use water consciously and sustainably, always with the aim of providing quality information and preserving our aquatic biodiversity.

## Details

EcoWater, in the blink of an eye, finds the nearest beaches to you. It's as simple as that. You select the beach you want to visit, tap on it, and enter a world of crucial information.

The app provides comprehensive details about water quality standards at that specific location, allowing you to make informed decisions about whether it's safe to swim.

But EcoWater goes beyond that. It not only informs about water quality but also provides guidance on how to use water for recreation safely and responsibly, without harming marine life or polluting bodies of water. Our simple and intuitive approach makes protecting aquatic resources an accessible task for everyone.

## Tools and data

The application was entirely developed using Jetpack Compose, which is a Kotlin-based UI library. It is the official library for Android devices and adheres to accessibility standards to ensure widespread accessibility of the tool.


During the development and data collection process, we actively searched for both national and international APIs. However, due to the challenge of finding APIs containing relevant information about water quality and/or data on threatened species in rivers, lakes, and seas, we chose to gather the necessary data from scientific research (dissertations and articles from the Federal University of Sergipe), official NGO websites (WWF, IUCN, TAMAR Project), and government websites (ANA, IBGE). We then synthesized this data to be presented through the app.



## Features

Water Quality Check:

On the main screen, users are presented with an interactive map displaying markers for bodies of water near their location.
The markers indicate the water quality based on the selected body of water by the user.
Water Information:

Once a user selects a beach or body of water of interest on the map, they are redirected to a location-specific information screen.
Here, they discover everything about the water and how to use it for recreation while ensuring safety for nature.
Preservation Guidelines:

The application not only provides information about water quality and biodiversity but also offers practical guidelines on how to interact with water responsibly.
This includes tips on how to swim or recreate in the water without harming aquatic biodiversity or polluting bodies of water.
Additionally, the app encourages campaign sharing with a share button.
